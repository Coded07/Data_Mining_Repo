This repository contains my data mining activities from class. Each activity uses a different dataset where I applied basic data mining techniques to extract insights and visualize results using graphs.

Each file in this repository represents a separate activity with its own dataset. The tasks include:
* Loading and exploring datasets
* Cleaning and preprocessing data
* Extracting useful patterns and insights
* Creating graphs and visualizations

Tools and Libraries
* Python 
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* numpy
* scipy (for statistical test like ANOVA)
* folium (for map visualization)
